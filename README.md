# Battle_Ship

### Description:
Battleship is a two-player game where each player has a board with a fleet of ships placed on it. Players take turns guessing the location of the other player's ships on a grid. A hit is when a ship is guessed correctly, and the first player to sink all the other player's ships wins.
This is a solution for the [Odin project assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship). The project was built using Javascript and Webpack (js bundler) and Jest for unit testing.

### How to play:
You will be playing against the computer: 
1. You start a new game by entering your name. 
2. Place your ships on your map vertically or horizontally. The game will begin after you finish placing your ships.
3. Each player will take a turn to try and hit the other player's ships.
4. The game will end if one player sinks all the other player's ships.
